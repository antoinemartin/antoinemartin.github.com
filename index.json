This sequence can slow down the destroy process and sometimes cause failures if the VM or disks are not in the expected state.

Similarly, Terraform attempts to delete data disk attachments before the VM, which would cause the disk to be actually unattached from the running VM, with possible unexpected results.

Remove Extensions and Disk Attachments from Terraform State To avoid Terraform explicitly deleting extensions and attachments, you can remove these resources from Terraform state, so Terraform forgets about them and lets Azure handle deletion cascades when the VM is deleted. Use shell commands like these to bulk-remove all extensions or data disk attachments from your state: # Remove all VM extensions from state terraform state rm $(terraform state list | grep azurerm_virtual_machine_extension) # Remove all data disk attachments from state terraform state rm $(terraform state list | grep azurerm_virtual_machine_data_disk_attachment) Note: Always back up your Terraform state file before performing bulk state removals. Backup \u0026 restore the terraform state Before performing any bulk state operations, it’s crucial to create a backup of your Terraform state file. Here is the recommended approach: # Pull current state to a local backup file terraform state pull \u003e terraform.tfstate.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S) # Verify the backup contains your resources terraform show terraform.tfstate.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S) To restore from backup if needed: # For remote state, push the backup back terraform state push terraform.tfstate.backup.20250105_143000 ","date":"05-08","objectID":"/posts/managing-azure-vm-disks-and-extensions-with-terraform-handling-dependency-and-state-removal/:2:1","tags":["Terraform","Azure","VM","Disks","Extensions","Infrastructure as Code"],"title":"Managing Azure VM Disks and Extensions with Terraform: Handling Dependency and State Removal","uri":"/posts/managing-azure-vm-disks-and-extensions-with-terraform-handling-dependency-and-state-removal/"},{"categories":null,"content":"2. Enforce Disk-VM Destroy Ordering Using depends_on Simply removing disk attachments from state can cause Terraform to try deleting disks before the VM, which fails if disks are still attached. The reliable fix is to add explicit dependencies so Terraform destroys resources in the correct order. For example, in your VM resource definition, add a depends_on block referencing the disks, ensuring Terraform deletes disks after the VM: resource \"azurerm_windows_virtual_machine\" \"vm\" { # VM configuration... depends_on = [ azurerm_managed_disk.additionnal_disks, # add all relevant disk attachment resources here ] } This setup tells Terraform: wait until those disk attachments are destroyed before deleting the VM, avoiding the race condition that causes failure.

Terraform often establishes implicit dependencies through references, but these sometimes represent only “resource existence,” not full “readiness.” Azure VM extensions and disk attachments require the VM to be fully provisioned (or deprovisioned) before related resources can be managed safely.

For disks, do not remove disk attachments or disks from state blindly. Instead, add explicit depends_on dependencies in the VM resource to ensure Terraform respects the correct destroy order. Always backup your Terraform state before any bulk operations. For quick environment cleanup, consider deleting the whole resource group which cascades deletes in Azure. Terraform allows robust, repeatable management of complex Azure infrastructures, but some manual steps and explicit dependency handling are necessary to optimize operations involving VMs with extensions and attached data disks. The approach described here — combining state resource removals and dependency declarations — has proven reliable in practice for ensuring clean, efficient VM destruction workflows.

This class is quite useful but you may find yourself scratching your head because your test does not work like it should. This happens in particular if you’re doing some background work in your service, relying for example on AsyncTask for it. Read on if you want to understand why it doesn’t work and find a solution for it. In an Android application, any service is instantiated and operates on the main thread. But this is not the case in the test framework provided by the ServiceTestCase class. Your Service is instantiated in the same thread the test runs. While your tests are running, there is no Looper waiting for messages on the service thread. In consequence, anything that relies on it and on the Handler class to communicate back to the main thread will not work. For instance, AsyncTask uses a handler to ensure that the onPostExecute method is called on the main thread. After doInBackground has been called, it posts a message on this handler, but as the Looper on the service is not running to handle the message, the onPostExecute method will never be called. To circumvent this behaviour, the service must be run on a separate thread with a Looper running.

It declares a Looper and a Hanlder to be able to run code on it: protected Handler serviceHandler; protected Looper serviceLooper; In the setup of the test, we instantiate the service thread, start it, and link our handler with its looper: @Override protected void setUp() throws Exception { super.setUp(); // Setup service thread HandlerThread serviceThread = new HandlerThread(\"[\" + serviceClass.getSimpleName() + \"Thread]\"); serviceThread.start(); serviceLooper = serviceThread.getLooper(); serviceHandler = new Handler(serviceLooper); } The corresponding tearDown method shuts down the tread. We provide a runOnServiceThread method to be able to run code on the service thread: protected void runOnServiceThread(final Runnable r) { final CountDownLatch serviceSignal = new CountDownLatch(1); serviceHandler.post(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { r.run(); serviceSignal.countDown(); } }); try { serviceSignal.await(); } catch (InterruptedException ie) { fail(\"The Service thread has been interrupted\"); } } Then, the startService methods starts the service in its own thread: static class Holder\u003cH\u003e { H value; } protected T startService(final boolean bound, final ServiceRunnable r) { final Holder\u003cT\u003e serviceHolder = new Holder\u003cT\u003e(); // I want to create my service in its own 'Main thread' // So it can use its handler runOnServiceThread(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { T service = null; if (bound) { /* IBinder binder = */bindService(new Intent(getContext(), serviceClass)); } else { startService(new Intent(getContext(), serviceClass)); } service = getService(); if (r != null) r.run(service); serviceHolder.value = service; } }); return serviceHolder.value; } The bound parameters tells whether to start the service with a binding or with an Intent..

There are several techniques for doing that, but the most common are : Broadcast an intent, or Call a callback method on listeners. This usually happens in the main thread. In our case, it would happen in the service thread. As the test is executing itself in its own thread, some synchronization mechanism is needed between the service thread and the test thread to be able to handle the outcome of the background task in the test. The ThreadServiceTestCase class provides an helper class for that: public static class ServiceSyncHelper { // The semaphore will wakeup clients protected final Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(0); /** * Waits for some response coming from the service. * * @param timeout * The maximum time to wait. * @throws InterruptedException * if the Thread is interrupted or reaches the timeout. */ public synchronized void waitListener(long timeout) throws InterruptedException { if (!semaphore.tryAcquire(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) throw new InterruptedException(); } } It contains a semaphore that can be used to synchronize the service thread with the test thread. In the case of the callback listener, we can then define an utility class like the following: static class SynchronizedListener extends ServiceSyncHelper { Object result; /** * Service listener that registers the value returned by the service in * the holder and release the semaphore. */ final MyService.Listener listener = new MyService.Listener() { public void onTaskPerformed(MyService service, Object returnValue) { result = returnValue; semaphore.release(); } }; } When notified by the service in the service thread, the contained listener releases the semaphore and awakes the test that is waiting on the semaphore. The listener contained in the helper class also needs to be added to the service being tested at service initialization. A test using this feature then becomes : public void testSomething() { // Catch listener callback in the test final SynchronizedListener listener = new SynchronizedListener(); // starts the service /* MyService service = */ startService(true, new ServiceRunnable() { @Override public void run(Service service) { // add our listener to the service service.addListener(listener); } }); // wait for the service to notify us try { // Wait for the service to perform its background task listener.waitListener(WAIT_TIME); } catch (InterruptedException ie) { fail(\"The listener never got signaled\"); } assertEquals(expected_value, listener.result ); ... } You can grab The ThreadServiceTestCase\u003cT extends Service\u003e source code here.

In that case, a few options aleardy exist, most notably the one developed by helicontech that relies on Microsoft’s Web Platform Installer. This solution, which is described here, relies on the installation of a specific native Handler developed by Helicontech. This handler manages the communication between IIS and the Django application through the FastCGI protocol with the help of a little python script that bridges FastCGI to WSGI. This script is derived from the Allan Saddi flup package that is already used by Django in the manage.py runfcgi command. The flup package doesn’t work under Windows and Helicontech has made the necessary adaptations to make it work with its handler. Since its version 7, IIS does however support FastCGI natively, so the use of a specific handler to support Django is not needed. This post describes how to configure and run a Django application with the native FastCGI IIS handler. For that, I have myself adapted the Helicontech FastCGI to WSGI script to make it a Django management command.

If like me for some reason it is uneasy for you to run a software installer on your server, a good choice is to use Portable Python.

If you are lazy like me, you may insert lazy logs like this one: Log.v(\"#LOOK#\", \"onStart()\"); Instead of having less lazy code like: public class SomeActivity extends Activity { private static final String LOG_TAG = SomeActivity.class .getSimpleName(); private static final int LOG_LEVEL = Log.VERBOSE; ... @Override public void onStart() { if (LOG_LEVEL \u003c= Log.VERBOSE) Log.v(LOG_TAG, \"onStart()\"); But Eclipse can easily help you to avoid this and then the need to clean up your code after debbuging. Everybody uses content assist in Eclipse. The CTRL+Space shortcut alleviates us from the need to type all those long field and method names that come out of our imagination. With the Templates feature, it can even write code for us. Templates are editable in the preferences. To see them, select Window \u003e Preferences and then in the preferences dialog, Java \u003e Editor \u003e Templates. The window looks like this: If you double click on a template you can edit it: The template name is what you type in the Editor window before hitting CTRL+Space and that will make Eclipse propose you the template. I won’t go into a full explanation of the syntax of the templates, but basically the template name is replaced by the template pattern and the content between the ${} is replaced either by what you type or by values computed by existing macros. DZone gives you a good Visual Guide to Template listing most common macros. Now we can create our templates for both adding the Log declarations at the beginning of our class as well as templates for inserting conditionally ran logs. For the header, we create a template named alh in Java types member context with the following pattern: ${:import(android.util.Log)}private static final String LOG_TAG = ${enclosing_type}.class.getSimpleName(); private static final int LOG_LEVEL = Log.${level}; ${cursor} The different ${} mean: ${:import(android.util.Log)}: make sure android.util.Log is imported. ${enclosing_type}: insert the name of the type (class) we’re in. ${level}: when inserting, put the cursor here and wait for the user to enter the level variable. ${cursor}: leave the cursor here when the user hits the ENTER key. With this template, inserting the log headers in a class is achievied with the following steps: type alh and hit STRL+Space. select the template (first choice) and hit ENTER enter the desired log level (DEBUG for instance) for the class and hit ENTER. continue coding. This is much simpler than copy-pasting the code from another class and replacing the class name and log level. The following template, named alv in the Java statement context is for inserting verbose logs: if (LOG_LEVEL \u003c= Log.VERBOSE) Log.v(LOG_TAG, \"${enclosing_method}() ${}\"); ${cursor} The nice thing is that it inserts the name of the current method and wait just after for your debug message. Just typing Enter will leave a log like: if (LOG_LEVEL \u003c= Log.VERBOSE) Log.v(LOG_TAG, \"onStart() \"); Which may be just enough. On this model, you can create ali, ald, ale templates for the different debug levels, or if you want to use String.format() templates like : if (LOG_LEVEL \u003c= Log.DEBUG) Log.d(LOG_TAG, String.format(\"${enclosing_method}() ${}\", ${args})); ${cursor} Just adapt them to your needs. Once you have finished debugging, if you change the LOG_LEVEL of your class from let’s say VERBOSE to INFO, all the alv templates you’ve entered will become dead code as the if surrounding the log lines is always false. This is because it compares static variables, and this is just what we want. When we compile for delivery, we want the compiler to optimize out all this code from the binary. However, the Java compiler will generate warnings for that. As it is not possible to surround the log with a @SuppressWarnings() attribute, you may want to change the error level of dead code from Warning to Ignore.

You can see that apart from Name and GenericName, the only line specific to the project is Path=/home/antoine/src/django/my_project/src/my_project/ It defines the project path, making it easy to reuse.
