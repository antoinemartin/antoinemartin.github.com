{% img right /images/antoine_martin.png Antoine Martin %}
I'm a *Hands on* seasoned Technical Manager with a strong expertise both in mobile applications and internet services development. 
In the 90s, I pioneered the French media Web with Libération, Le Monde and France Télévisions. 

I built my expertise in mobile applications development since 2001, well before the rise of the iPhone and Android platforms. 
First with embedded navigation and next with mobile imaging, I managed to get my hands dirty with virtually every embedded platform,
from handset vendors proprietary platforms to iOS and Android through Windows Mobile, J2ME, Symbian, Doja and even Brew.

On the server side, although I master the J2EE platform, my preference goes to Open Source and dynamic scripting languages, especially
python and Django. 

Entrepreneur, Team builder and technical mentor, I Love to build teams and make things happen.

I'm the owner of [Openance](http://www.openance.com).
