You can start over from a clean sheet with docker system prune --all but sometimes you would like to keep some images around. This post shows how to set up multiple docker environments on Windows with the help of WSL2 (Windows Subsystem For Linux) and Alpine.
How it works The idea is to run docker on WSL and use a docker alias on the windows side to invoke the docker command in the WSL distribution.</description></item><item><title>Checking Google Play Signatures on .Net</title><link>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/11/15/checking-google-play-signatures-on-net/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Antoine Martin</author><guid>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/11/15/checking-google-play-signatures-on-net/</guid><description>With In-App Billing on Android, each time a purchase occurs, your application receives a JSON payload containing information about the purchase, as well as its signature with your developer certificate.
Google encourages you to verify that the signature is valid to authentify the purchase. You can do that inside the application, but if the delivery of the purchase involves a server, it is better to do it on the server to prevent client code manipulation.</description></item><item><title>Avoid Thread Issues While Testing an Android Service</title><link>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/11/08/avoid-thread-issues-while-testing-an-android-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Antoine Martin</author><guid>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/11/08/avoid-thread-issues-while-testing-an-android-service/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>The

<p>This class is quite useful but you may find yourself scratching your head
because your test does not work like it should. This happens in particular if

If you are lazy like me, you may insert lazy logs like this one:
1  Log.v(&#34;#LOOK#&#34;, &#34;onStart()&#34;);   Instead of having less lazy code like:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  public class SomeActivity extends Activity { private static final String LOG_TAG = SomeActivity.]]></description></item><item><title>Start a Virtualenv Django Shell From the Linux Desktop</title><link>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/03/13/start-a-virtualenv-django-shell-from-the-linux-desktop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Antoine Martin</author><guid>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/03/13/start-a-virtualenv-django-shell-from-the-linux-desktop/</guid><description>If you are tired to fire a terminal window, cd to your project directory and activate your python virtualenv to get to your Django project, you will find here some tips to improve things a little bit.
This tip is divided in two parts :
First we create a shell startup script that activates the virtualenv, bash completion and cd in the project directory. Then we create a Linux Desktop Entry file That spawns a console in our environment.</description></item><item><title>Checking Google Play Signatures With Django</title><link>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/03/12/checking-google-play-signatures-with-django/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Antoine Martin</author><guid>http://mrtn.me/posts/2012/03/12/checking-google-play-signatures-with-django/</guid><description>Google play, formerly known as the Android Market, provides in-app billing in several countries. In the Security and Design page, Google states the following:
If practical, you should perform signature verification on a remote server and not on a device. Implementing the verification process on a server makes it difficult for attackers to break the verification process by reverse engineering your .apk file. If you do offload security processing to a remote server, be sure that the device-server handshake is secure.</description></item></channel></rss>
