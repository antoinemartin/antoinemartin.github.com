I'm a _Hands on_ seasoned Technical Manager with a strong expertise both in
mobile applications and backend services development. In the 90s, I pioneered
the French media Web with Libération, Le Monde and France Télévisions.

I started building my expertise in mobile applications in 2001, well before the
rise of the iPhone and Android platforms. First with embedded navigation and
next with mobile imaging, I managed to get my hands dirty with virtually every
phone platform, from handset vendors proprietary ones to iOS and Android through
Windows Mobile, J2ME, Symbian, Doja and even Brew.

On the server side, I followed the state of the art technologies as they
matured, starting from basic CGI up to GRPC and Websockets, through Perl, PHP,
JSP/J2EE, ASP, Struts, Spring, .Net, Rails, Django, NestJS, GraphQL... I mounted
servers on racks but was more than happy to build virtual infrastructures with
code when it became possible.

I had the chance to work in startups, medium sized enterprises as well as in
fortune 500 companies in utilities, media and high tech. I eventually served as
VP Engineering, but never stopped programming (and enjoying it).

Entrepreneur, Team builder and technical mentor, I Love to build teams and make
things happen.
