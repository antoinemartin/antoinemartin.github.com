I'm a _hands-on_ technical leader with deep expertise in mobile apps, web
front-end and backend services. Back in the 90s, I helped pioneer the French
media web with Libération, Le Monde, and France Télévisions.

Got into mobile development in 2001, way before iPhones were cool. Started with
embedded navigation and mobile imaging, then got my hands dirty with pretty much
every platform out there—from proprietary handset OSes to iOS and Android, plus
all the fun stuff like Windows Mobile, J2ME, Symbian, Doja, and even Qualcomm's
Brew.

On the web frontend side, I've seen it all evolve from static HTML to today's
reactive frameworks, going through the whole templating era—JSP, PHP, ASP,
Django templates, and finally landing on React, Angular, Vue and the modern
JavaScript ecosystem.

On the server side, I've ridden the wave from basic CGI to modern GRPC and
WebSockets, picking up everything along the way: Perl, PHP, J2EE, Rails, Django,
FastAPI, NestJS, GraphQL... You name it. I've literally mounted servers in racks
_and_ built cloud infrastructure with code. Deployed on all the major
clouds—AWS, Azure and GCP and french ones OVHCloud (OpenStack) and Scaleway.

I've worked everywhere from startups to Fortune 500s in utilities, media, and
tech. I eventually served as VP Engineering and CTO but never stopped coding
(because honestly, it's still fun).

Entrepreneur, Team builder and technical mentor, I Love to cultivate software
ecosystems and make things happen.
